# Penetration Testing

## Project Overview

The Penetration Testing Lab evaluates and develops essential hacking tools for security audits. We utilize data from the [HoneyNet project](https://github.com/alanshlam/HoneyNet) to assess attackers' capabilities in exploiting vulnerabilities. Our project also focuses on enhancing IT infrastructure security by evaluating methodologies and tools such as Network Monitoring, Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). We continuously refine our hacking tools to address evolving cybersecurity threats and work towards proactive risk mitigation. Our goal is to  establish best practices for deploying and configuring security components, ensuring real-time threat detection and response and contribute to a safer digital environment through knowledge sharing and continuous improvement.


## Studies

- **Using Nmap and Metasploit for Penetration Testing**
  - The video below demonstrates how to use Nmap as a port scanner and vulnerability scanner to provide a low-cost solution during the reconnaissance process in a security audit. This video also demonstrates how to effectively use Metasploit in Kali Linux for penetration testing and verifying vulnerabilities discovered in the reconnaissance process.

     You can download the network packet pcap file of the SMB break in at (https://github.com/alanshlam/HoneyNet/blob/main/pcap/smb.pcap)

- **Intercepting HTTPS Traffic via MITM Attack**
  - The video below demonstrates how an attacker can intercept HTTPS traffic and snoop on victim password information using a MITM attack via ARP poisoning. The demostration in this video shows that it is possible to sniff user passwords even in HTTPS traffic, which is encrypted by session key.

     You can download the network packet pcap file of this MITH attack  in at (https://github.com/alanshlam/HoneyNet/blob/main/pcap/mitm.pcap)
 

- **Time-based Blind SQL Injection**
  - The video below demonstrates how to dump a website database information, including user password hashes, using Time-based Blind SQL Injection. This type of injection relies on the database pausing for a specified amount of time before returning results, indicating successful query execution. The attacker enumerates each letter of the desired data using logic that causes the database to wait if a condition is met. You can get the source code of this Time-based Blind SQL Injection used in this demonstration from [here](./code/).

- **Setting Up IPS with Suricata**
  - The video below demonstrates how to deploy an IPS to block network attacks, such as Nmap scans or SQL injection attacks, using Suricata. This IPS helps a network prevent cyberattacks even if there are vulnerable systems behind the firewall.

- **IT Infrastructure Monitoring**
  - The screenshots below demonstrate how to effectively monitor IT infrastructure using MRTG, Nagios, ntop-ng, and nfsen-ng. These system and network monitoring tools help system administrators closely monitor their IT infrastructure and discover any suspicious network activities or potential attacks.
  - The ntop-ng shows the server network interface traffic

  - The ntop-ng shows the active flow in a network

  - The nagios monitor the critical service in the IT infrastructure and send alerts when detected

## Future Work

- **AI Integration:** Apply AI technologies to automatically perform security audits in the preliminary stages, such as information gathering during the reconnaissance process.
- **Knowledge Base Development:** Build a knowledge base of know-hows in this project with the help of large language models (LLMs).
- **Capacity Enhancement:** Enhance the Penetration Testing Labâ€™s capacity to study advanced hacking techniques according to the latest released CVEs.
- **Countermeasure Evaluation:** Evaluate countermeasures against the latest hacking techniques, such as Firewall, IDS, and IPS
