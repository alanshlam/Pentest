# Penetration Testing

## Project Overview

The Penetration Testing Lab has evaluated and developed various hacking tools that are crucial during the penetration testing process of security audits. The data collected from the [HoneyNet project](https://github.com/alanshlam/HoneyNet) helps assess the attackers’ capabilities in exploiting system vulnerabilities. This project also focuses on evaluating methodologies and tools to enhance IT infrastructure security capabilities within the IT industry, including effective deployment of Network Monitoring, Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).

## Studies

- **Using Nmap and Metasploit for Penetration Testing**
  - The video below demonstrates how to use Nmap as a port scanner and vulnerability scanner to provide a low-cost solution during the reconnaissance process in a security audit. This video also demonstrates how to effectively use Metasploit in Kali Linux for penetration testing and verifying vulnerabilities discovered in the reconnaissance process.

     You can download the network packet pcap file of the SMB break in at (https://github.com/alanshlam/HoneyNet/blob/main/pcap/smb.pcap)

- **Intercepting HTTPS Traffic via MITM Attack**
  - The video below demonstrates how an attacker can intercept HTTPS traffic and snoop on victim password information using a MITM attack via ARP poisoning. The demostration in this video shows that it is possible to sniff user passwords even in HTTPS traffic, which is encrypted by session key.

 

- **Time-based Blind SQL Injection**
  - The video below demonstrates how to dump a website database information, including user password hashes, using Time-based Blind SQL Injection. This type of injection relies on the database pausing for a specified amount of time before returning results, indicating successful query execution. The attacker enumerates each letter of the desired data using logic that causes the database to wait if a condition is met. You can get the source code of the Time-based Blind SQL Injection used in this demonstration from [here](./code/).

- **IT Infrastructure Monitoring**
  - The video below demonstrates how to effectively monitor IT infrastructure using MRTG, Nagios, ntop-ng, and nfsen-ng. These system and network monitoring tools help system administrators closely monitor their IT infrastructure and discover any suspicious network activities or potential attacks.



- **Setting Up IPS with Suricata**
  - The video below demonstrates how to set up an IPS to block network attacks, such as Nmap scans or SQL injection attacks, using Suricata. This IPS helps a network prevent cyberattacks even if there are vulnerable systems behind the firewall.

  

## Future Work

- **AI Integration:** Apply AI technologies to automatically perform security audits in the preliminary stages, such as information gathering during the reconnaissance process.
- **Knowledge Base Development:** Build a knowledge base of know-hows in this project with the help of large language models (LLMs).
- **Capacity Enhancement:** Enhance the Penetration Testing Lab’s capacity to study advanced hacking techniques according to the latest released CVEs.
- **Countermeasure Evaluation:** Evaluate countermeasures against the latest hacking techniques, such as Firewall, IDS, and IPS
